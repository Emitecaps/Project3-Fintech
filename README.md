## What is VGG19?
A convolutional neural network is also known as a ConvNet, which is a kind of artificial neural network. A convolutional neural network has an input layer, an output layer, and various hidden layers. VGG19 is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is considered to be one of the best computer vision models to date. The creators of this model evaluated the networks and increased the depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which showed a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations. They pushed the depth to 19 weight layers making it approx — 138 trainable parameters.

CNN is a concept of a neural network. Its main attributes may be that it consists of convolution layers, pooling layers , activation layers etc. VGG is a specific convolutional network designed for classification and localization.

The VGG19 Architecture was developed and introduced by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman from the University of Oxford, in the year 2014, through their article “Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition.” 

What is VGG19 used for?
VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.


## VGG19 Architecture:

The number 19 in the name VGG refers to the fact that it is 19 layers deep neural network (VGGnet). This means that VGG19 is a pretty extensive network and has a total of around 138 million parameters.

The most unique thing about VGG19 is that instead of having a large number of hyper-parameters they focused on having convolution layers of 3x3 filter with stride 1 and always used the same padding and maxpool layer of 2x2 filter of stride 2.

In the 1st attempt to create NFTs, I had fun playing with the generative arts code inputting different shapes, colors & background colors.

The 2nd time around, I used CNN which is a version of deep learning pre trained model which has 19 layers which are the weights. An image & a background image were merged together to create a unique image. As the process is happening, images go through a loss-best loss and generate 10 of the same merged images. They get more granier towards the end.

This process is popular with artists and designers that want to develop new artwork based on existent art.

From the generations, I chose the ones that looked the best and created a collection to OpenSea and uploaded each image individually while transacting with MetaMask on the Polygon (MATIC) network to pay a small fee to list them and once they sell. I will have the seller pay the listed price to my wallet address on MetaMask.
